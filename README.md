# face-injector-v2
if you want to see the original readme, you can refer to the original one [here](https://github.com/KANKOSHEV/face-injector-v2/blob/main/README.md)

### what this repo is
this is simply just a "updated" version of face injector that uses a newer version of kdu and forces a provider\
in testing, this works on the latest version of windows 10 and 11 (also tested insider builds)

### what this repo isn't
* **undetected/less detectable face injector** (the mapper driver still retains the same driver name)
* **a newer version of the injector** (the code is still entirely the same)

### important note
it seems like the gputweak 2 driver is a little odd, so the first time it tries to init the driver it could potentially fail. just run it again and it should work fine.
